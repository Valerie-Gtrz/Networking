#Meetups and Job Fairs - Assignment




##I recently had the opportunity to attend a _[JavaScript Live Webinar](https://www.meetup.com/hackreactoratx/events/278654264/)_ hosted by *[Alex Jean-Baptiste]*(https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexjeanb/).

###The information in the event taught about the history of JavaScript for the first half. I learned a lot about how and when JavaScript started as a programming language and how it has changed. The later half of the course focused mostly on how-to’s for beginners but I found the teamwork and online interaction to be rewarding. I also found that the instructor’s teaching style served as an excellent example in leadership. I connected with 3 of other attendees including the instructor all on LinkedIn. We were also invited to join the instructor’s LinkedIn learning group [Taught By Alex.](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13974752/) and it seemed like another great opportunity to network so I decided to join that as well.
