# Meetups and Job Fairs - Assignment



### I recently took the opportunity to network by attending a **[Live JavaScript Webinar](https://www.meetup.com/hackreactoratx/events/278654264/)** hosted by *[Alex Jean-Baptiste](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexjeanb).*

### The event spaned over two and half hours with about 45 attendees. The first segment was spent learning the history of JavaScript and it taught me a lot about how and when the language started and how it has changed. The latter half of the course focused mostly on how-to exercises for beginners and although the assignments were very basic, I found the teamwork and online interaction to be rewarding. I also though that the instructor’s teaching style served as an excellent example in leadership. I connected with three other attendees including the instructor all on LinkedIn. We were also invited to join the instructor’s LinkedIn learning group [Taught By Alex.](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13974752/) and it seemed like another great opportunity to network so I decided to join that as well. Overall, I enjoyed my networking experience and look forward to making more connections! :smile_cat:
